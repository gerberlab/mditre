For example Rule 3 Detector 0 reads: TRUE for Plant diet if the average slope of selected taxa between days 1 to 9 is greater than -0.0023. This rule captures the pattern that the abundances of selected clade of taxa (shown on the right in the figure) increase at a rate higher than -0.0023 per day between days 1 to 9 for subjects with Plant-based diet. In each of the plots, the red dashed line shows the median slope of all subjects and the black dashed line shows the learned threshold of -0.0023."
