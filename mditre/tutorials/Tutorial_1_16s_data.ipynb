    "### Required files\n",
    "#### Abundance data\n",
    "A CSV file containing the microbial abundances, formatted with the first row providing OTU IDs and the first column providing sample IDs. See [here](./datasets/raw/david/abundance.csv) for the abundance data file for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Subject metadata\n",
    "A CSV file that gives information about each subject, (including the value of whatever variable will be used as the host outcome for prediction (e.g., Plant-diet or Animal-diet in the David et al). See [here](./datasets/raw/david/subject_data.csv) for the subject metadata file for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pplacer output\n",
    "A ```.jplace``` file created by placing the representative sequences from each OTU on a reference tree of known 16S rRNA amplicon sequences using the [pplacer](https://matsen.fhcrc.org/pplacer/) package. See [here](./datasets/raw/david/placements.jplace) for the pplacer output file for this dataset.

    "The software requires user-defined config file with the desired data loading and preprocessing options. A pre-defined config file for this dataset is found [here](./datasets/raw/david/david_benchmark.cfg). Looking into this file, one can see a section ```[data]``` that contains the flags specifying the locations of the required data files and also a ```[preprocessing]``` section with the optional data preprocessing flags, described in detail in our user manual. The following are the flags the user will always need to specify in the config file.\n",

    "- <strong>sample_metadata</strong>: Location of sample metadata file\n",
    "- <strong>subject_data</strong>: Location of subject metadata file\n",
    "- <strong>jplace_file</strong>: Location of the pplacer generated .jplace file\n",
    "- <strong>outcome_variable</strong>: A string specifying which of the columns in the subject metadata table encodes the host status variable for prediction (For example, 'diet').\n",
    "- <strong>outcome_positive_value</strong>: The value of the host status variable that corresponds to a 'positive' outcome (for example, 'Plant'; the choice doesn't affect the model and is just used for labeling outputs)\n",

The full description of the command line arguments accepted by the model code is located in the documentation [here](https://github.com/gerberlab/mditre/blob/master/mditre/docs/config_doc.pdf). A brief summary of the required options to be passed as arguments to the command are as follows.\n",

    "- After running the rule visualizer utlity as shown before, a separate window pops up showing the log-odds of all the learned rules as heatmaps. In this example, we see that the model was able to learn 2 rules (rule 1 and rule 2). The topmost panel shows the log-odds of individual rules. This is followed by 2 panels showing the predicted log-odds of each rule individually for each subject. The next panel shows the combined log-odds of both rules for each subjects. Finally, a panel showing ground truth labels for each subject (Plant vs Animal diet). A rule with positive log-odds is predictive of the positive outcome (in this case Plant-diet) and vice-versa. As we can see, both rules individually and collectively can perfectly classify the subjects based on their outcomes. Next, in order to view the learned rules, one can click on the button (that says \"Click\").\n",
    "- Clicking on a button to the left of the heatmap of rule 1 opens a separate window. This window shows the text of the rules on the top, followed by a panel showing the detector activations for each subject as a heatmap. As we see, the rule is predictive of Animal-diet and therefore the detector is active (True) for all the subjects with Animal-diet. Since this rule contains only 1 detector, we omit showing the conjunction of all the detectors in a separate panel.\n",
    "- Next, the user can click on the button to the left of the detector heatmap, which opens a separate window showing the average rate of change of abundances (slope) over time for the 2 groups of subjects of the selected taxa (shown as a tree on the right), along with the heatmaps of the slope within the selected time window (day 10 - 15). <strong>Note, if the figure does not fit the screen, please click on \"Configure subplots\" button (located to the left of the zoom tool on the top left), and then click \"tight layout\" option.</strong> The purpose of this visualization is to allow the user to explore the differences in the temporal dynamics of the selected taxa both within and outside the selected time window between the subjects. One can see that the abundances of subjects with Animal diet increase at a higher rate (colored towards red) than the ones with Plant-diet (colored towrads blue) during days 10 - 15. An opposite effect can be observed during days 6 - 9, which is the period of the actual dietary intervention. This allows the user to gain insights into the effect of the dietary intervention on the microbiome.\n",
    "- We also provide a button located in the bottom right, which when clicked opens a separate window with the full phylogenetic tree of taxa. Using the zoom tool located at the top left of the new window, one can see the selected taxa (with red branches) in the context of the other nearby taxa in the full phylogenetic tree."
